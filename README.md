# Eye-Movement
Eye Movement Exercise
Description of Project: When the HTML is opened, two eyes will appear on the user's screen. As the user moves their mouse around the screen,
the eyes will follow the mouse!
How to Run: The user simply has to move the mouse around the screen to see the eyes move!

Roadmap of future improvements: I think adding a feature to make the eyes blink would be a cool improvement. 
License information: This project was made for the MIT xPro program, edits were made by myself.
